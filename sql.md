-- SELECT * FROM usa_gdp WHERE year < 1970;

```

* LAG(column) OVER (ORDER BY ...) is a window function that lets you peek at the value from a previous row ‚Äî  without doing a self-join.
* every column in the SELECT clause that‚Äôs not an aggregate (like COUNT) must be included in the GROUP BY.

Aggregate Window Functions
These apply aggregate logic across a moving window of rows:

Function	Description
SUM()	Running total across a partition
AVG()	Moving average
COUNT()	Row count within a window
MIN()	Minimum value in the window
MAX()	Maximum value in the window

Ranking Window Functions
Used to assign ranks or positions within partitions:

Function	Description
ROW_NUMBER()	Sequential row number (no ties)
RANK()	Rank with gaps for ties
DENSE_RANK()	Rank without gaps for ties
NTILE(n)	Divides rows into n buckets
üîÅ Value-Based Window Functions
These let you access values from other rows relative to the current one:

Function	Description
LAG()	Value from a previous row
LEAD()	Value from a following row
FIRST_VALUE()	First value in the window
LAST_VALUE()	Last value in the window
NTH_VALUE(n)	nth value in the window

Statistical & Distribution Functions (engine-dependent)
Function	Description
PERCENT_RANK()	Relative rank as a percentage
CUME_DIST()	Cumulative distribution
