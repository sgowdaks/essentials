* Docker runs on top of the OS, but it talks directly to the kernel to create and manage containers.
* It uses the kernel (especially Linux kernel features like namespaces and cgroups) to isolate containers.
* On Linux, Docker uses the host‚Äôs kernel directly.
* On Windows/macOS, Docker runs a lightweight Linux VM (via WSL2 or HyperKit) because containers need a Linux-compatible kernel.

# Docker simple file creation

## Install Python 
 * Download Miniconda Installer : `wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh` 
 * Run the Installer: `bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh` 
 * Activate Conda: `source ~/miniconda3/bin/activate`
 * conda initilization: `conda init`

## Install Docker
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

## Create Docker Image

Docker Script
```
# Use a base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the script into the container
COPY app.py .

# Define the command to run the script
CMD ["python", "app.py"] 

```

* Create a Dockerfile: `touch Dockerfile` and add the above script into the docker file
* Create a simple hello world python file: `app.py`
* Add Your User to the Docker Group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
* Build docker image: `docker build -t my-python-app .`
* Run docker container: `docker run my-python-app` (non interative)
* Run the container: `docker run -it ymy-python-app` (interactive)
* List running container: `docker ps`
* List running container that has completed excecuted: `docker ps -a`
* Docker Images: `docker images`
* Keeps running the short docker: `docker run -it --name <container name> my-python-app tail -f /dev/null`
* Docker command to get into the conatiner: `docker exec -it <container name> /bin/bash` -> if bash is supported else `/bin/sh`
*  Docker port mapping from container 8080 to local machine 80: `docker run -d -p 8080:80 simple-webapp`
*  Docker container stop: `docker stop <container name`


## Docker Multiple Container vs Docker Compose

Docker Compose offers several advantages that make it much better for managing multi-container applications:

üîÅ 1. Single Command to Manage Everything
With Docker Compose, you can start, stop, and rebuild all your services with just one command:

`docker-compose up`

Without Compose, you'd need to run multiple docker run commands and manage networking manually.

üßæ 2. Centralized Configuration

All your service definitions (images, ports, volumes, environment variables, dependencies) are in one file: docker-compose.yml. This makes it:

* Easier to read and maintain
* Easier to share with your team
* Version-controllable with Git
  
üîó 3. Automatic Networking
Compose automatically creates a network and connects your containers to it. Services can talk to each other by name (e.g., db for the database container), without needing to know IP addresses.

‚è≥ 4. Service Dependencies
You can define dependencies using depends_on, so services start in the right order. For example:

```
web:
  depends_on:
    - db
```

This ensures the database starts before the web app tries to connect.

üß™ 5. Easier Testing and Scaling

You can:
* Spin up test environments quickly
* Scale services with docker-compose up --scale web=3

üßº 6. Clean Shutdown and Cleanup
With docker-compose down, you can stop all services and remove networks, volumes, and containers in one go.
